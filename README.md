# Movie Correlation Analysis using Python

This repository provides a movie correlation analysis using Python. The analysis aims to explore the relationships and correlations between different movie attributes, such as ratings, genres, and revenue.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of movie data, including information such as movie title, genre, ratings, and revenue. The dataset includes the following columns:

- Name
- Rating
- Genre
- Year
- Released
- Score
- Votes
- Director
- Writer
- Star
- Country
- Budget
- Gross
- Company
- Runtime

The dataset is available in the file `movies.csv`.

## Analysis

In this repository, we have implemented movie correlation analysis using Python and popular data analysis libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The code for performing the correlation analysis can be found in the `Movie Correlation Project using Python.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. Loading and preprocessing the movie dataset.
2. Exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.
3. Computing correlation coefficients between different movie attributes.
4. Visualizing the correlation matrix using heatmaps and scatter plots.

## Getting Started

To get started with the movie correlation analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, install it using `pip install jupyter`.
4. Open the `Movie Correlation Project using Python.ipynb` Notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
5. Follow the instructions in the Notebook to load and analyze the movie dataset.
6. Modify the code or add additional analysis as needed.

## Results

After performing the movie correlation analysis, you will gain insights into the relationships between different movie attributes. The Notebook provides visualizations and correlation coefficients to help you understand the impact of factors like ratings and genres on movie revenue.
